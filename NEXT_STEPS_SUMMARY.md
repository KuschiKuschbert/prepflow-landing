## üîÑ Remaining Tasks

### 3. Test Authentication Flow (Next Priority)

**Requirements:**

- Valid Auth0 account
- Allowlisted email in `.env.local` (currently `derkusch@gmail.com`)

**Steps:**

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/webapp` route
3. Complete Auth0 login
4. Verify redirect and session persistence

**Expected Result:** Successful login and access to webapp dashboard

---

### 4. Verify Webapp Pages (After Auth)

**Pages to Test:**

- `/webapp` - Dashboard with stats
- `/webapp/ingredients` - 155 ingredients should display
- `/webapp/recipes` - 14 recipes should display
- `/webapp/cogs` - COGS calculator
- `/webapp/performance` - Performance analysis
- `/webapp/temperature` - Temperature monitoring
- `/webapp/cleaning` - Cleaning roster
- `/webapp/compliance` - Compliance tracking
- `/webapp/suppliers` - Supplier management

**Expected Result:** All pages load with data displayed correctly

---

### 5. Test API Endpoints (With Authentication)

**Critical Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/ingredients` - Should return 155 items
- `GET /api/recipes` - Should return 14 recipes
- `GET /api/performance` - Should analyze menu dishes
- `GET /api/temperature-equipment` - Should return 87 items
- `GET /api/cleaning-areas` - Should return 36 areas

**Expected Result:** All endpoints return data successfully

---

### 6. End-to-End User Journey Tests

**Journey 1: Ingredients Management**

1. Login to webapp
2. Navigate to Ingredients
3. View list of 155 ingredients
4. Add new ingredient
5. Edit existing ingredient
6. Delete ingredient

**Journey 2: Recipe Management**

1. Navigate to Recipes
2. Create new recipe
3. Add ingredients to recipe
4. Calculate COGS
5. Save as menu dish

**Journey 3: Performance Analysis**

1. Navigate to Performance
2. View Chef's Kiss / Hidden Gem / Bargain Bucket / Burnt Toast classifications
3. Verify calculations are correct

**Expected Result:** All user journeys complete without errors
