## 🎯 Performance Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Bundle Size Reduction (Immediate)

#### 1.1 **Code Splitting Implementation**

- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Lazy load webapp components
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 30-40% bundle size reduction

#### 1.2 **Dependency Optimization**

- [ ] Audit and remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- [ ] Tree-shake unused code
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 20-30% bundle size reduction

#### 1.3 **Asset Optimization**

- [ ] Implement text compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Optimize remaining images
- [ ] Minimize CSS and JS files
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 15-25% size reduction

### Phase 2: Runtime Performance (Week 2)

#### 2.1 **Main Thread Optimization**

- [ ] Implement Web Workers for heavy computations
- [ ] Optimize React rendering with memoization
- [ ] Reduce JavaScript execution time
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 50-70% main thread work reduction

#### 2.2 **Loading Performance**

- [ ] Implement service worker for caching
- [ ] Add resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- [ ] Optimize critical rendering path
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 40-60% faster loading

### Phase 3: Accessibility & Polish (Week 3)

#### 3.1 **Form Accessibility**

- [ ] Add proper labels to all form elements
- [ ] Implement ARIA attributes
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Expected Impact:** 100% accessibility compliance

#### 3.2 **User Experience**
