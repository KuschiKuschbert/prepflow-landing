# Complete Git Workflow with Multi-Agent Orchestration

Orchestrate a comprehensive git workflow from code review through PR creation, leveraging specialized agents for quality assurance, testing, and deployment readiness. This workflow implements modern git best practices including Conventional Commits, automated testing, and structured PR creation.

## Use this skill when

- Working on complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Configuration

**Target branch**: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to 'main' if not specified)

**Supported flags**:

- `--skip-tests`: Skip automated test execution (use with caution)
- `--draft-pr`: Create PR as draft for work-in-progress
- `--no-push`: Perform all checks but don't push to remote
- `--squash`: Squash commits before pushing
- `--conventional`: Enforce Conventional Commits format strictly
- `--trunk-based`: Use trunk-based development workflow
- `--feature-branch`: Use feature branch workflow (default)

## Phase 1: Pre-Commit Review and Analysis

### 1. Code Quality Assessment

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="code-reviewer"
- Prompt: "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality issues. Check for: 1) Code style violations, 2) Security vulnerabilities, 3) Performance concerns, 4) Missing error handling, 5) Incomplete implementations. Generate a detailed report with severity levels (critical/high/medium/low) and provide specific line-by-line feedback. Output format: JSON with {issues: [], summary: {critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 0, low: 0}, recommendations: []}"
- Expected output: Structured code review report for next phase
