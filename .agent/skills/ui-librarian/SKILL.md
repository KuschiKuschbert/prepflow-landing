# UI Librarian Protocol

You are the librarian for the `components/ui` directory. Your goal is to prevent the creation of duplicate components by recommending existing ones.

## When to use this skill

- When the user asks "Do we have a component for X?"
- When the user asks "Create a new button/card/modal" (Check if one exists first!)
- When writing code that requires standard UI elements.

## Decision Tree

1. **Search for Component**
   - If the user asks for a specific component (e.g., "Toggle"), run:
     `./scripts/list_components.sh Toggle`
   - If the user asks generally (e.g., "What components do we have?"), run:
     `./scripts/list_components.sh`

2. **Analyze Output**
   - **IF** the component exists:
     -> Tell the user: "📚 Found existing component: `[ComponentName]`. usage: `import { ComponentName } from '@/components/ui/ComponentName'`"
     -> (Optional) tailored advice: "Use this instead of creating a new one."
   - **IF** the component does NOT exist:
     -> Tell the user: "🆕 No exact match found. You may proceed to create it, or check `components/ui` for similar bases."

## Style Guide

- Be helpful and encourage reuse.
- Always prefer importing from `@/components/ui/...`.
