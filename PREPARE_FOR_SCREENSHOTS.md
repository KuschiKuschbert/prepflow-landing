# Ready for Screenshots!

## ✅ Everything is Ready

All code has been updated to use your new screenshots. You just need to add the image files!

## 📸 What You Need to Do

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open your webapp** (already running at http://localhost:3000)
2. **Take 3 screenshots:**
   - Ingredients Management page (`/webapp/ingredients`)
   - COGS Calculator page (`/webapp/cogs`)
   - Cleaning Roster page (`/webapp/cleaning`)
3. **Save them to:** `public/images/` folder
4. **Name them exactly:**
   - `ingredients-management-screenshot.png`
   - `cogs-calculator-screenshot.png`
   - `cleaning-roster-screenshot.png`

## 🎯 That's It!

Once the files are in place, the landing page will automatically use them. No code changes needed - everything is already set up!

## 💡 Pro Tip

Use Chrome DevTools to take full-page screenshots:
1. Open the page
2. Press `Cmd + Option + I` (DevTools)
3. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Command palette)
4. Type: "Capture full size screenshot"
5. Screenshot downloads automatically
6. Rename and move to `public/images/`
