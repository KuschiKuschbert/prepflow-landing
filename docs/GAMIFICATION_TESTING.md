## Browser Console Test Commands

Run these in the browser console to manually test:

```javascript
// Check achievement stats
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('prepflow-achievement-stats'));

// Check unlocked achievements
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('prepflow-achievements'));

// Check shown milestones
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('prepflow-milestones-shown'));

// Manually trigger achievement (for testing)
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent('personality:achievement', {
    detail: {
      achievement: {
        id: 'TEST',
        name: 'Test Achievement',
        description: 'This is a test',
        icon: '🧪',
        unlockedAt: Date.now(),
      },
    },
  }),
);

// Manually trigger milestone (for testing)
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent('gamification:milestone', {
    detail: {
      milestone: {
        id: 'test-milestone',
        type: 'usage',
        name: 'Test Milestone',
        description: 'This is a test milestone',
        threshold: 1,
        icon: '🎯',
      },
    },
  }),
);
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Indicators

- All achievements unlock correctly
- Milestones trigger at correct thresholds
- Confetti animations are subtle (not overwhelming)
- Toast notifications appear and auto-dismiss
- Stats persist across page refreshes
- NavbarStats updates in real-time
- AchievementsDropdown shows correct data
- No console errors

### ❌ Failure Indicators

- Achievements don't unlock
- Milestones trigger multiple times
- Confetti is too intense or doesn't trigger
- Toast notifications don't appear
- Stats don't persist
- NavbarStats doesn't update
- AchievementsDropdown shows incorrect data
- Console errors present

## Troubleshooting

### Achievements Not Unlocking

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify personality system is enabled (check settings)
3. Check localStorage for achievement stats
4. Verify tracking functions are being called

### Milestones Not Triggering

1. Check if milestone was already shown (localStorage)
2. Verify milestone threshold is correct
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify milestone check functions are being called

### Stats Not Updating

1. Check sessionStorage/localStorage directly
2. Verify event listeners are attached
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify stats functions are being called

### Toast Not Appearing

1. Check if component is mounted (MilestoneToast, AchievementToast)
2. Verify event is being dispatched
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify personality system is enabled

## Next Steps

After testing, if everything works:

1. ✅ Mark testing complete
2. ✅ Document any issues found
