**Solution:**

1. Check Vercel environment variables
2. Verify `AUTH0_SECRET` is set (should be 32+ characters)
3. Verify `AUTH0_BASE_URL` is set to `https://www.prepflow.org`
4. Check Vercel build logs for Auth0 SDK warnings

---

### Issue: Redirect Loop

**Possible Causes:**

- Callback URL not configured in Auth0 Dashboard
- Middleware redirecting incorrectly
- Auth0 SDK route handler not working

**Solution:**

1. Check Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Settings → Allowed Callback URLs

4. Verify `[...auth0]/route.ts` exists and is correct

---

### Issue: Session Not Persisting

**Possible Causes:**
