# Archived root-level docs

These files were moved from the project root on 2026-02-08 to declutter the repo. They are one-off progress notes, audit reports, and setup guides that are superseded by the main `docs/` content or no longer needed for day-to-day work.

- **Screenshots / assets:** `*SCREENSHOT*.md`, `*CAPTURE*.md`, etc.
- **Audit / compliance:** `*AUDIT*.md`, `*COMPLIANCE*.md`, etc.
- **Setup / migration:** `SETUP_*.md`, `QUICK_*.md`, `*MIGRATION*.md`, etc.
- **Optimistic updates / phase 5:** `OPTIMISTIC_*.md`, `PHASE_5_*.md`, etc.
- **Other:** `MANUAL_FIX_PLAN.md`, `CONTINUITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `EMAIL_TO_DANIEL.txt`, etc.

You can delete this folder entirely if you are sure none of these are needed for reference.
