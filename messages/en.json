        "So I built my own solution - a simple Google Sheets template that could handle COGS calculations, track ingredient costs, and show me exactly which menu items were profitable and which were losing money.",
        "Having worked across Europe and Australia, I've refined it to work perfectly for venues worldwide - with GST support for Australian markets, multi-currency options, and the flexibility to adapt to any kitchen's needs. It's the tool I wish I had when I started, and now I'm sharing it with you."
