# Logo Integration Guide for PrepFlow Landing Page

## Current Logo Setup
The landing page currently uses a placeholder logo made with CSS shapes:
- **Placeholder:** Geometric circles in your brand colors (#29E7CD, #3B82F6, #D925C7)
- **Text:** "PrepFlow" with gradient styling

## Logo Replacement Steps

### 1. Add Your Logo File
Place your PrepFlow logo in the `public/images/` folder:
- **Recommended file:** `prepflow-logo.png` or `prepflow-logo.svg`
- **Format:** PNG (for transparency) or SVG (for scalability)
- **Size:** Recommended 200x80px or similar aspect ratio
- **Background:** Transparent or dark background to match the theme

### 2. File Naming Convention
Use one of these names:
- `prepflow-logo.png` - Most common
- `logo.png` - Simple
- `prepflow-logo.svg` - Vector format (best for scaling)

### 3. Logo Placement
The logo will replace:
- The CSS circle shapes in the header
- Keep the "PrepFlow" text below it
- Maintain the same layout and positioning

## Implementation
Once you add your logo file, I'll update the code to:
- Replace the CSS placeholder with your actual logo image
- Maintain responsive design
- Keep the existing styling and layout
- Ensure proper accessibility with alt text

## Current Brand Colors Used
- **Primary:** #29E7CD (Electric Cyan)
- **Secondary:** #3B82F6 (Blue)
- **Accent:** #D925C7 (Vibrant Magenta)

These colors are used throughout the design and should complement your logo.
